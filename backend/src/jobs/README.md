# Visit reminder job

This directory contains bounded background jobs. `visit-reminder.job.js` sweeps server-authoritative visit snapshots, evaluates reminder deadlines using timezone-aware instants and emits stable idempotency keys. The job does not mutate visit state; repository integration owns durable schedule-version invalidation and delivery records.
